= Fundraising

For better or for worse, the party cannot exist without money.

- @maintain: Maintain our current dues.
- @reduce: Reduce dues.
- @increase: Increase dues.

@maintain
subtitle: [+ dues +] resources gained.
on-arrival: resources += dues;

We maintain our current dues.

@reduce
subtitle: [+ dues - 1 +] resources gained.
choose-if: dues > 1
on-arrival: dues -= 1; resources += dues;

Our current members appreciate this, but no one decides to join a party because of the low dues.

@increase
subtitle: [+ dues + 1 +] resources gained. [? if unemployed >= 15 : Given the present economic situation, this may be painful. ?][? if dues >= 4 : Dues are already rather high; increasing them might reduce our membership. ?]
on-arrival: dues += 1; resources += dues; workers_nlp -= 4; new_middle_nlp -= 3; old_middle_nlp -= 2; workers_nlp -= 10 if unemployed >= 15; workers_nlp -= 2*dues if dues >= 5; new_middle_nlp -= dues if dues >= 5;
view-if: dues <= 4

Our members grumble at this, and some of the less committed members leave. But now, we have access to additional resources. 

[? if unemployed >= 15 : Because of the presently high unemployment, our members are feeling the extra burden hard. ?]
